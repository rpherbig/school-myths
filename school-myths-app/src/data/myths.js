    fact: "Taste buds that detect sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami are distributed all over your tongue, not in specific zones.",

    fact: "Lemmings do not commit suicide. This myth was created by a fraudulent 1958 Disney documentary that pushed lemmings off cliffs for dramatic effect.",
    details: "The lemming suicide myth originated from Disney's 'White Wilderness' documentary, where filmmakers deliberately pushed dozens of lemmings off a cliff while filming. In reality, lemmings migrate when populations grow too large, and some may accidentally drown while swimming across water obstacles during dispersal. Their behavior is mass migration, not suicide. The myth persists as a metaphor for blindly following crowds toward disaster.",

Studies show that 70% of students don't even use study strategies matching their self-reported style, and those who do show no academic benefit. More effective universal strategies include spaced practice, self-testing, and experiencing material in multiple ways.

In Salem, witchcraft was treated as a felony under colonial law, not heresy under church law. The 19 executed victims were hanged at Gallows Hill, and one man, Giles Corey, was pressed to death with stones for refusing to enter a plea. Burning at the stake was used in Europe for heresy cases, but American colonial law used hanging for witchcraft convictions.",
