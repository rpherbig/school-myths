    myth: "Different parts of your tongue taste different flavors",
    fact: "Taste buds that detect sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami are distributed all over your tongue, not in specific zones.",
    details: "The 'tongue map' was based on a mistranslation of German research from 1901. While some areas may be slightly more sensitive to certain tastes, all taste buds can detect all basic flavors."

    myth: "Lightning never strikes the same place twice",
    fact: "Lightning frequently strikes the same location multiple times, especially tall structures.",
    details: "The Empire State Building is struck by lightning about 25 times per year. Lightning follows the path of least resistance, which often leads to the same high points repeatedly."

    fact: "Educated people in medieval Europe knew the Earth was round.",

    myth: "You only use 10% of your brain",
    fact: "You use virtually all of your brain, even during simple tasks.",
    details: "Brain imaging shows activity throughout the brain even during rest. Damage to almost any area of the brain causes noticeable effects. This myth likely persists because it suggests untapped potential."

    myth: "Different colored flames are always hotter or cooler",
    fact: "Flame color depends on the chemical composition and available oxygen, not just temperature.",
    details: "While blue flames are often hotter than yellow ones in gas burners, adding certain chemicals can create colored flames at various temperatures. Copper creates green flames, sodium creates yellow-orange flames, regardless of temperature."

    myth: "Hair and fingernails continue growing after death",
    fact: "Hair and nails don't actually grow after death; the skin shrinks as it dehydrates.",
    details: "Cell growth requires energy and nutrients that stop flowing after death. The appearance of growth comes from skin dehydration and shrinkage, making existing hair and nails more prominent."

    myth: "You can see the Great Wall of China from space with the naked eye",
    fact: "The Great Wall is not visible from space with the naked eye.",
    details: "While satellites can photograph the wall, it's not visible to astronauts without aid. Many other human-made structures are actually more visible from space, like city lights and large airports."

    myth: "Napoleon was unusually short for his time",
    fact: "Napoleon was average height for 18th-century French men at about 5'7\".",
    details: "The confusion arose from differences between French and English measurement systems. French measurements made him appear shorter when converted. He was actually slightly taller than the average man of his era."
